# Bear Bones - We'll leave the designing to you

*******************************
Including font files
You can include external css files like Google Web fonts or Font Awesome in the Appearance > Customize > Style Options

Custom CSS
You can add custom css in the Appearance > Customize > Style Options. However, this theme was made so that all css could be handled in the style.css file.

Including custom js in your theme. 
You can write custom code and put in the custom.js file located in the /js/ folder. One file include in the following order:
	/js/min/custom.min.js
	/min/custom.min.js
	/js/custom.js
	custom.js
Or you can create your own file and include it in the Appearance > Customize > Js options.

Extra widgets support
You can add home widgets or footer widgets just by adding "home-widget-top", "home-widget-bottom", "footer-widget", "footer-widget-2", 
"posts-widget-top", "posts-widget-bottom", "page-widget-top", "page-widget-bottom" in the Appearance > Customize > Additional Widgets section. 
Home-widget-top will be added before the content on the home page, home-widget-bottom will be added after the content on the home page, 
footer-widget will be loaded before footer-widget-2 and both will be loaded before copyright if selected in Appearance > Customize > Footer.

You can add as many custom widgets as you want by adding them into the Appearance > Customize > Additional Widgets section. To get them to 
display on a page or post, add a custom field "widget-top" to display before the content, "widget-bottom" to display after the content, replace 
the sidebar with another widget by using custom field "replace-sidebar", add an additional widget to sidebar by using "add-to-sidebar"

NOTE: "posts-widget-top" & "page-widget-top" will display before "widget-top" custom field. "posts-widget-bottom" & "page-widget-bottom" will 
display after "widget-bottom" custom field.

*******************************

Bear Bones is meant to include all of the essentials of a good website framework without all of the design elements, SEO and other random 
functions that everyone seems to throw in.

A special thanks go to the following themes, designers, etc. that have provided their work for free and contribute so much to the web 
development community. Without Open Source this theme would not exist.

Bones by Eddie Machado - http://themble.com/bones
- Arguably the best bare bones WordPress theme (that is until Bear Bones came along). A LOT of the way this theme is done is because of 
the awesome work by Eddie. 

320 and Up by Andy Clarke - http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/
- All websites should be built with this in mind. It just plain makes sense

InuitCSS by Harry Roberts - http://inuitcss.com/
- In my opinion, inuitcss is the BEST grid system out there. Bear bones takes soooo much from this framework.  I started creating Bear Bones 
before Harry Roberts changed up inuit.css to what it is today. I had already started implementing my own way before he began redoing inuit.css. 
It uses SASS (which is arguably the best css preprocessor) but I started with LESS and I know a lot of other developers that still use it. 
There are some others that manage the LESS version. Just do a search... you'll find it.

HTML5 Boilerplate by Nicolas Gallagher, Paul Irish, Mathias Byens, Divya Manian, and Hans Christian Reinl - http://html5boilerplate.com/
- There's no denying the impact this boilerplate has made on the front-end community and web projects. If you haven't used it in your projects, you should.


Some plugins that I highly recommend:

Wordfence Security - http://www.wordfence.com/
	Awesome security plugin. There are other great ones, too! So use what is best for your website.
	
WordPress SEO by Yoast - https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/
	Does just about everything you would want an SEO plugin to do. Of course, if you don't like it, use what is best for your website.
	
Flexible Posts Widget - https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-posts-widget/
	A widget where you can easily create templates to display posts, including custom post types, pages, etc. in any way you want. Multiple 
	sorting options, thumbnail options. 

Post Editor Zen Coding - http://wordpress.org/plugins/post-editor-zen-coding/
	You can use Zen Coding right in the post editor from the website. So easy to use.
